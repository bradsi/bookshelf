Bookshelf is a toy project I'm building to do some learning experiments.

My goals with the project are as follows:
- [ ] CRUD features
- [ ] Use [Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) and/or [Rector Laravel](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector-laravel) to upgrade from PHP 7.4 to PHP 8.1
- [ ] Practice unit testing and feature testing using [Pest](https://github.com/pestphp/pest) and implement [PCOV](https://github.com/krakjoe/pcov)
- [ ] Create a style guide based on [PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/)
- [ ] Implement the style guide with [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer)
- [x] Implement static analysis with [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) and [Larastan](https://github.com/nunomaduro/larastan)
- [ ] Setup GitHub Actions or Bitbucket Pipelines to run CI i.e. Pest, PCOV, PHPStan
- [ ] Containerise the application using Docker
- [ ] Put into practice what I've learned from Jonathan Reinink's Eloquent Performance Patterns course
- [ ] Try to identify some functionality that can be extracted from the application and built into a package
- [ ] Deploy the application on AWS
- [ ] Improve Actions or Pipelines to run CD on the application
- [ ] Put into practice what I've learned from the Refactoring UI course
- [ ] Play around with [Mermaid.js](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid); alternatively use draw.io to diagram some processes, but I like the idea of 'diagrams as code'
- [ ] Implement [Shepherd.js](https://github.com/shipshapecode/shepherd)
- [ ] Implement something like Dependabot to keep track of security flaws
- [ ] Implement uptime monitoring
- [ ] Implement real time notifications
- [ ] Application Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] PWA
- [ ] Make a nice README
